## Why I chose Euclide's algorithm

Ever since we studied the GCD and the Euclidean algorithm at school, I've been wondering about what it would look like in a programming language, that is because I'd often come across the word _algorithm_ in programming communities. As I've been learning the basics of javascript lately, I thought I'd try to code it in js.

## Something unclear?
